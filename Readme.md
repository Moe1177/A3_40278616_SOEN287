This is a simple website that allows users to put up their pet for adoption or adopt one. 

I put all the .ejs files in a folder called view (because that is what the client views). In the general directory there is the server file which I called app.js.

For this project the modules I used were express, ejs, fs, path, body-parser and session to download these dependencies just write in the command line: (npm install {name-of-dependency}).

To run this program locally head over to app.js open the terminal and write: 
(node app.js). 

Then, in the console there will appear a link to a local host 3000 click that and then your in.

Dummy logins can be found in the data folder.
Public folder holds all the css, images and javascript (for the date)
